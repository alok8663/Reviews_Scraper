        "Review_Body": "I'm a huge fan of the Conversations with God series by Neale W Donald, and this book seems to be in that category, but just hitting the high spots.\n\nIt does seem to repeat a few thoughts/statements a few times, but having read the entire book, I (think I) understand why and wouldn't change it.\n\nThis book is addressed to those who over-think, don't know why they do it, are tired with it and want to do something about it. It plays in the space of spirituality, emotional intelligence and what I'd call 'universal truth' - something so simple to understand if we want to, but ridiculously difficult to apply on a consistent basis... Very possible, and simultaneously difficult.\n\nAnd I'd DEFINITELY recommend this book as a MUST HAVE on everyone's list, as something to return to every 1 yerr (if not more frequently)"

The book has completly changed my life - I feel more free, weightless, happy, joy after reading this book and believing in the wisdom I got. Very well structured and easy to follow, and understand. Progresssion of chapters are really nice and at some point (very soon after few pages only), you will find every line starts making good sense and feels like coming from simple but divine wisdome, so good. I felt extremly emotional and grateful at the end of the book, close to finishing . Almost cried reading last line ."

        "Review_Body": "This book has helped me a lot in controlling negative thoughts, unmindful thinking and the resulting unnecessary anxiety and stress. After I lost my father in 2022 to a sudden cardiac arrest, I dived deep into severe depression and anxiety. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt even realise I was getting sucked into this quagmire of depression, until my work, my relationships started getting affected. I realised that I was actually having negative thoughts always and it was difficult to control them. It was in 2023 that I bought this book after an influencer on Instagram mentioned about it. I read the book in intervals of bad phases of depression and anxiety. In the beginning of the book, the author promises that you won‚Äôt be the same person once you finish this book. No matter how unreal it seemed at that moment, I thought it to be a publicity gimmick and didn‚Äôt believe in it at all.\nI finished my book in the first of week of November 2024. I cried when the Author once again mentions towards the end of the book‚Ä¶that you won‚Äôt be the same person once you finish reading and that we can‚Äôt unlearn something we have already learnt. I cried with a knowing smile on my lips‚Ä¶and silently thanking the Author ‚Äì Joseph Nguyen.\n\nTo Joseph ‚Äì if you ever read this - I wish to thank you from the bottom of my heart. God bless you. You have helped me take charge of my thinking. I thank you for being the teacher and guiding star ‚Äì that I needed. Negative thoughts come to my mind even now‚Ä¶but your words remind me to just stop them on their tracks. I know I would be reading your book again and again. Thank you.\n\nP. S. This Amazon account belongs to my husband and had to post this review from his account as he purchased the book."

        "Review_Body": "I picked up this book because I was intrigued by its cover and title, of course! On the contrary, it stayed on my shelf until very recently, when I picked it up to escape a reading slump.\n\nAnd boy oh boy, how cool it was to finally dive in. Though short, it carries a profound message about our thoughts, actions, and mind. I‚Äôm sure by now everyone knows we have thousands of thoughts a day. It‚Äôs impossible not to think, but it is possible not to think about our thoughts‚Äîget it?\n\nOur suffering begins when we overthink our thinking, fixating on particular thoughts. The book explains that if we can just stop thinking about our thoughts, we may end much of our suffering. Our thoughts are a complex mix of experiences, biases, fears, and aspirations, shaped by our past, societal influences, and upbringing. You‚Äôll be surprised to realise how many of these thoughts have no real relation to reality‚Äîmost are illogical, just patterns we‚Äôve inherited.\n\nThe solution? Simple, though not easy. We must stop overthinking our thoughts. We‚Äôll always have opinions and beliefs about everything, but we need to resist the urge to spiral into further thoughts about those opinions. By practicing detachment, we can observe our thoughts as they pass by, like clouds in the sky, without identifying with them or letting them control our emotions and actions.\n\nThis practice allows us to reclaim our power of choice. When we stop believing every thought that enters our mind, we regain the ability to decide which ones matter and which ones don‚Äôt.\n\nUltimately, this book was a profound discovery for me. It deepened my understanding of thoughts and emotions. No thought is inherently positive or negative‚Äîit‚Äôs us who categorise them. It‚Äôs a great read that encourages us to look beyond the surface of our thoughts, approach them with healthy skepticism, and live in a more balanced, empowered way."

The author has beautifully woven profound insights with relatable stories, making complex ideas about overthinking and self-awareness easy to grasp.\n\nThe book not only addresses common patterns of human thinking but also provides a clear path toward self-realization and mental freedom. After reading it, I felt unburdened from the overwhelming cycle of overthinking, and I now have tools to better navigate my thoughts and emotions.\n\nJoseph Nguyen's writing is heartfelt, engaging, and deeply impactful. This book is a must-read for anyone struggling with overthinking or feeling stuck in their mental patterns. It has been a game-changer for me, and I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nThank you, Joseph Nguyen, for creating such a transformative and life-changing book!"

        "Review_Body": "In a world saturated with information and distractions, finding a book that not only captures your attention but also offers profound insights into the human experience is a rare gem. This transformative piece invites readers to embark on a journey of self-discovery, challenging the very fabric of their thoughts and beliefs.\nBeyond mere entertainment, books have the power to impact our lives in profound ways. Joseph Nguyen's book is a testament to the transformative potential of literature, particularly in the realm of mindful living.\nIn a society where the constant chatter of social media and the hustle and bustle of daily life often drown out our inner voices, a book that encourages introspection is a breath of fresh air. \"Don‚Äôt Believe Everything You Think\" serves as a guide to understanding the intricate dance between our thoughts and emotions, offering tools for cultivating a more mindful and purposeful existence.\nThe title itself hints at the core message of the book - the pivotal role our thoughts play in shaping our experiences. Nguyen skillfully weaves together ancient wisdom and modern psychology to explore the roots of suffering and how our own minds can either perpetuate or alleviate it. Readers are taken on a journey through the intricacies of the human mind, with each chapter offering insights and practical exercises to foster self-awareness. Nguyen's writing is accessible and engaging, making complex concepts digestible for readers at various stages of their mindfulness journey.\nThe book encourages readers to adopt a more mindful way of thinking, emphasizing the importance of being present in each moment. Through personal anecdotes, philosophical reflections, and practical exercises, Nguyen guides readers towards a deeper understanding of their own thought processes and the impact they have on their overall well-being.\nAs you delve into the pages of this insightful book, you may find that the key to ending unnecessary suffering lies within the very thoughts you choose to believe."

        "Review_Body": "The book came in perfect condition with a timely delivery.\n\nMy rating for the book is ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ\n\nThe book has a strong central point which is about differentiating between thoughts and thinking. I like that. There are really good insights around that and it is supported with practical and acceptable thought experiments. But the book just stops right there. Nothing new or anything more insightful beyond conveying thinking affects your life.\n\nIf you're writing about something psychological, spiritual, and a big game changer in anyone's life, then you must give some real-life examples apart from the age-old Zen stories.\n\nLet's take the Psychology of money, Housel explains the battle of Stalingrad to make you understand the preparation you must have for an emergency fund. That's all it is. I can never forget both the battle and the emergency fund. Take Atomic Habits, Clear would've explained the importance of habits with a simple equation of getting better by 1% every day and moves on to explain other parts of Habits. That's how the book should've been structured. You just say less to give a bigger impact and move on to other areas of thinking and thoughts instead of simply reiterating the thoughts are good, thinking is bad, and so on.\n\nThis book has good content, but I won't recommend reading this because an ordinary medium blog or a Quora answer can substitute what Nguyen wrote for 160 pages. Of course, there are a lot of positive things in this book but those are not something that will inspire you or make you go wow I should follow this!\n\nI won't recommend this book, but I'll appreciate the importance it gave to the thoughts and thinking.\n\nDo not pick this book."

        "Review_Body": "I don‚Äôt know ki mere Andar achanak se itna books padhne ka kira kha se aa gaya. but then I started searching for books on Amazon and, with some friends' suggestions, ordered a few books. Then, I began reading, and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Believe Everything You Think‚Äù was the first book I picked up.\n\nI was struggling with negative thoughts and overthinking, but this book helped me understand how to deal with these prolonged, negative thoughts. It clarified the differences between thoughts and thinking. The key message I took away was, ‚ÄúStop Thinking and End Your Problems.‚Äù Overall, it‚Äôs a great, eye-opening, and easy-to-read book.\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone facing negative thoughts and wanting to be filled with love, hope, and peace. Once you complete reading this book, it will change the way you look at life, the way you think, and the way you feel.\n\nThank you so much Joseph Nguyen for this eyes opening book ( at least for me ), You're amazing :)"
